ðŸ‘‹ About Me
I am an information security enthusiast with a strong focus on Bug Bounty and vulnerability assessment in web applications. I am continuously studying exploitation techniques, penetration testing methodologies, and best practices used by security researchers to identify flaws and help protect systems.

ðŸ’» Main areas of interest:

Reconnaissance and information gathering

Web application vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)

Manual and automated testing

Tools like Burp Suite, Nmap, Sublist3r, ffuf, and others

Responsible disclosure practices and clear communication with security teams

ðŸ§  Constantly learning, with a focus on ethics, responsibility, and the ongoing development of technical skills.

ðŸ“‚ This GitHub is used to organize study materials, helper scripts, and notes related to my progress in the field.
